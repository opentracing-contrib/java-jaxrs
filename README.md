# OpenTracing JAX-RS Instrumentation TEST

OpenTracing instrumentation for JAX-RS standard. It supports tracing of server and client requests.

Instrumentation by default adds a set of standard HTTP tags and as an operation name it uses a string defined in `@Path` annotation.
Custom tags or operation name can be added in span decorators.
It also traces writing response and requests bodies.

## Microprofile-OpenTracing
This implementation is also compatible with [Microprofile-OpenTracing](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing).
It can be used as a component inside Microprofile compatible application server. Note that
application servers have to add a few thing which are not provided by this component: CDI interceptor, 
automatically register tracing filters into client...

## Tracing server requests
By default OpenTracing provider is automatically discovered and registered.
The only configuration that is required is to register a tracer instance via `GlobalTracer.register(tracer)` at application startup.

### Custom configuration
Custom configuration is only required when using a different set of span decoratos.

```java
// code sample from javax.ws.rs.core.Application
public Set<Object> getSingletons() {
  DynamicFeature tracing = new ServerTracingDynamicFeature.Builder(tracer)
      .withDecorators(decorators)
      .withSerializationDecorators(serializationDecorators)
      .build();

  return Collections.singleton(tracing);
}

```
            
An example of traced REST endpoint:
```java
@GET
@Path("/hello")
@Traced(operationName = "helloRenamed") // optional, see javadoc
public Response hello() { // optional to get server span context

  // this span will be ChildOf of span representing server request processing
  Span childSpan = tracer.buildSpan("businessOperation")
          .start())

   // business logic
  childSpan.finish();

  return Response.status(Response.Status.OK).build();
}
```

## Tracing client requests
```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newBuilder()
  .reqister(ClientTracingFeature.class)
  .build();

Response response = client.target("http://localhost/endpoint")
  .request()
  .property(TracingProperties.CHILD_OF, parentSpanContext) // optional, by default new parent is inferred from span source
  .property(TracingProperties.TRACING_DISABLED, false) // optional, by default everything is traced
  .get();
```

### Async
Async requests are executed in a different thread than when the client has been invoked, therefore
spans representing client requests are not connected to appropriate parent. To fix this JAX-RS client
has to use OpenTracing-aware [`ExecutorService`](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-concurrent).

#### Jersey
```java
@ClientAsyncExecutor
public class DelegateExecutorServiceProvider implements ExecutorServiceProvider {

  private final ExecutorService executorService;

  public DelegateExecutorServiceProvider(ExecutorService executorService) {
    this.executorService = executorService;
  }

  @Override
  public ExecutorService getExecutorService() {
    return executorService;
  }

  @Override
  public void dispose(ExecutorService executorService) {
  }
}

Client client = ClientBuilder.newBuilder()
    .register(new DelegateExecutorServiceProvider(
        new TracedExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8), tracer)))
    ...
```

#### RestEasy
```java
Client client = new ResteasyClientBuilder()
    .asyncExecutor(new TracedExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8), tracer))
    ...
```

## Development

./mvnw clean install
